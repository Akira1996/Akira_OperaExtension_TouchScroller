Akira_OperaExtension_TouchScroller
==================================
This is an addon for the Opera web browser.
https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/touchscroller

Touch::Scroller allows you to pan a web page by sliding your fingers on your touchscreen. It also works with the left button of your regular mouse.
Page panning is affected by inertia. If you take your finger off while sliding the page, it goes on panning for a while then smoothly stops. Friction parameter in options page allows you to tune inertia (the lower the friction, the longer the page will pan).
While in touchscreen mode, text selection is disabled.
You can switch between touchscreen mode and desktop mode by clicking the icon or pressing the chosen hotkey.
